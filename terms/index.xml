What is Salina? Salina is a software product which generates a transcript from your therapy session, and finds key information for your clinician.
Why use Salina? It saves your clinician time, so they can focus on you.
It helps your clinician by measuring changes in things like how quickly you speak.
How does it work? Your clinician records your session, and Salina processes the audio, by machine, to produce a transcript.</description></item><item><title>Salina Health Privacy Policy</title><link>/terms/privacy/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/terms/privacy/</guid><description>This version: 11 August 2023
