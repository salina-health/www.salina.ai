## Do more of what you do best

With 1 in every 8 people living with a mental health problem [^1],
we need to improve access to expert help. 

Online therapy has improved access [^2], but valuable time is spent on administrative tasks such as note-taking.

Salina's AI automates note-taking, freeing you up to spend more time helping your clients.

Salina's notes summarize the session and highlight key information, alongside a full transcript of the session.

Save time and money by letting Salina take care of your notes.
