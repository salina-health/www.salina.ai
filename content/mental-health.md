## Consultations are the bedrock of mental health

With 1 in every 8 people in the world living with a mental disorder[^1],
access to professional help is challenging. 

The dominance of online[^2] video and audio sessions provides access,
but also a rich data source that is currently under analyzed.

## Therapy intelligence

> You're likely spending 10 or 20 minutes producing notes for a one-hour session. You could be using that time help your clients.

Salina's AI aims to provide automated therapy intelligence, extracting insights from audio and natural language:

- anonymize and summarize the session, saving time;

- list symptoms mentioned by the patient; and

- extracting key voice markers from sessions, to consistently track changes over sessions.


## Value to the clinic, therapist, and patient

Note-taking and summarization features of Salina can lead to significant savings per session, with the potential to dramatically change the economics of a session for the clinician. More time free makes more sessions available, allowing for access to increase.

Salina is in pre-release development. If you'd like to get involved, [contact us](/contact/) or complete our {{<survey>}}.
