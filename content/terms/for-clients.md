Your therapist would like to start using Salina in your sessions.

## What is Salina?

Salina is a software product which generates a transcript from your therapy session, and finds key information for your therapist. 

This is done automatically by the software. No one is involved other than your therapist.

Your information can be deleted by your therapist, and we don't use it for any other purpose.


## Why use Salina?

It saves your therapist time, so they can focus on helping you.


## How does it work?

Your clinician records your session, and Salina processes the audio to produce a transcript. 

This is anonymized and then processed further to identify themes and other information that is useful for the therapist.

This means your therapist can focus on you, not note taking.

## How is my data used?

The data is only used by your therapist. It is stored securely and your therapist can delete it.

If youâ€™d like to be included in our research projects for improving Salina and measuring how well it works, we can let you know when the next research project starts.

We encourage you to check out our [full privacy policy](/terms/privacy).
