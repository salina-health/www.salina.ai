Your clinician would like to start using Salina in your sessions.

## What is Salina?

Salina is a software product which generates a transcript from your therapy session, and finds key information for your clinician. 

## Why use Salina?

- It saves your clinician time, so they can focus on you.

- It helps your clinician by measuring changes in things like how quickly you speak.

## How does it work?

Your clinician records your session, and Salina processes the audio, by machine, to produce a transcript. 

This is anonymized and then processed to identify themes, and other features of interest to the clinician.

This means your clinician can focus on you, not note taking.

## How is my data used?

The data is only used by your clinician. It is stored securely, and they can delete it.

If youâ€™d like to be included in our research projects for improving Salina and measuring how well Salina works, you can be offered that when the next research project starts.

We encourage you to check out our [full privacy policy](/terms/privacy).
