Your therapist uses Salina to make notes and support your therapy. To do this, Salina needs to capture information about your therapy session. This privacy notice provides information on how Salina collects and processes your personal data.

## The personal information we collect

We collect the following types of information:

1. *Identifying data*: email address (if provided), name (if provided).

2. *Session recordings*: the audio or video of a therapy session.

3. *Health information*: automated transcription of your session, notes and insights from the session.

## How we get the information and why we have it

The information we collect is provided by your therapist, from recordings, or directly from you if you interact with the Salina web site.

We collect this for the provision of the Salina service. 

The legal basis for collecting this data is consent. For your therapist to use Salina, we require your consent.

## How we store your information

Your information is stored securely in the EU.

Using Salina, your therapist will have access to the recording and other health information until they delete it. 

## How we process your information

Salina collects and processes the audio of your therapy session, and uses AI to transcribe, summarise and generate observations for use by your therapist. By doing this, your therapist can spend more time helping you.

Your data is processed by us, using IT hosting and software providers.

Some of these operate in the US and some in Europe and we only use these services if there are adequate legal data transfer agreements in place. 

The following providers store your audio until your therapist deletes it, and provide data processing to turn your audio into a transcript and anonymise the transcript:

- Amazon ([GDPR Centre statement](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/gdpr-center/))
- Google Cloud EU ([Privacy and GDPR statement](https://cloud.google.com/privacy/gdpr))
- Northflank Ltd: ([Security and data statement](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1f6qam2AvHBQP9Q2FDZlFXGoaDErF9hkK/view))

The following processors transform anonymized session data and discard it afterwards:

- OpenAI Inc: https://openai.com/security
- Anthropic: https://trust.anthropic.com/

Salina, and none of the processors above, use your information other than to provide Salina services to you and your therapist.
