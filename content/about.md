Salina Health is an early-stage technology company targeting psychological therapy.

We extract insights from language and voice to:

- Saves therapists valuable time;
- deliver better therapy; and
- helps more patients access therapy.

# How we work

We're creating AI tools for therapy session analytics and ongoing patient monitoring. This could provide significant [efficiencies at clinics](/mental-health) with the growth of remote therapy providers, and [add insights](/voice-markers) with language and voice metrics. 

These services is provided as a software-as-a-service.

We prefer to partner with patient management software companies to deliver the technologies. If you're a PMS interested in Salina, do [get in touch](/contact).

# Applications outside of mental health

The key technology is also applicable in physical health, and we are running a pilot project in [oncology](/oncology) with an NHS partner.
