Salina Health is an early-stage technology company aiming to enhance psychological therapy.

We analyse language and voice to:

- save therapists valuable time;
- deliver better therapy; and
- help more clients access therapy.

# How we work

We're creating AI tools for therapy sessions and ongoing client monitoring. This [saves time](/mental-health) for therapists working online, and provides [valuable insights](/voice-markers) drawn from measurements of language and voice. 

We work with patient management software companies as well as individual therapists. If you're a PMS interested in Salina, do [get in touch](/contact).

# Applications outside of mental health

The key technology is also applicable in physical health, and we are running a pilot project in [oncology](/oncology) with an NHS partner.
