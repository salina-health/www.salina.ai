Salina Health is an early-stage technology company targetting two areas:

- <a href="/mental-health">Mental health</a>, with the automated understanding of online therapy sessions and extraction of objective voice markers related to clinical indications such as  depression and anxiety.

- <a href="/oncology/">Oncology</a>, automated detection of laryngeal (voice box) cancer risk, with an NHS partner.

Both areas share the same underlying Salina platform.

# How we work

We're creating AI tools for patient triage, therapy session analytics and ongoing patient monitoring. This could provide significant efficiencies at clinics with the growth of remote therapy providers.

These services will be provided, B2B, as a software-as-a-service.

We prefer to partner with patient management software companies to deliver the technologies. If you're a PMS interested in Salina, do [get in touch](/contact).


# Value

The three key benefits save time and gives an enhanced service to patients:

- Time saving in automated note-taking and analysis from consultations.

- Triage efficiency, improving patient journeys.
