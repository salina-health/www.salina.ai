## Frequently asked questions

- Q: Do I need a credit card or start payment? A: No, we're not charging for Salina at this stage.

- Q: How do you make money? A: We're a start-up company, funded by forward-thinking funds who believe we can build a great therapy product that clinicians will want to use and pay for in due course. 

- Q: Do you sell or use therapy data beyond what I need? A: No: we're in the business of making a product therapists want to use, and not in the business of using the data beyond that. 

- Q: Can I upload sessions that I've already recorded to Salina? A: Yes, we keep client data confidential and secure, and have a full [privacy policy](/terms/privacy/) and [service agreement](/terms/service/), plus [materials to help you describe Salina to your clients](/terms/for-clients/).

Other questions: ask then during the on-boarding session, or email <hello@salina.ai>.
