Today, patients presenting at primary care with a "hoarse voice" are referred to head and neck cancer clinics. Of the estimated 28,000 annual referrals in England, the vast majority (93%) do not have cancer. 

The Salina project — partnering with an NHS Trust — aims to divert benign vocal problems into more appropriate care pathways. 

This has the potential to streamline care, realizing multiple benefits to patients and healthcare systems.
