## What your patient says, and how they say it, contains a wealth of information

Voice markers are being used to track the progression of Parkinsonâ€™s, cardiovascular disease, COVID-19, and more[^1], but they have yet to become available to psychological practice. 

## Moving from subjective to objective metrics

Salina calculates a range of values to allow you to track changes across sessions. 

While not a diagnostic, the metrics save you the time of measuring speaking rate, frequency of language used, along with loundness and other aspects of the human voice.

Salina consistently records these, allowing you to spot patterns of change in a patient.
