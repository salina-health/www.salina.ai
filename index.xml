Of the estimated 28,000 annual referrals in England, the vast majority (93%) do not have cancer.
The Salina project — partnering with an NHS Trust — aims to divert benign vocal problems into more appropriate care pathways.
This has the potential to streamline care, realizing multiple benefits to patients and healthcare systems.</description></item><item><title>Salina Health Cookies</title><link>/terms/cookies/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/terms/cookies/</guid><description>This site, salina.ai, does not use cookies.
